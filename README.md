## how to run the project


this project contain two folder
1- BackEnd folder
2- FrontEnd folder

You must download these two folders then run each of them to run the project in the browser

### BackEnd

The first thing you need to do is install the node_modules by running this command in the terminal

```
npm i
```
 And I use an online database (MongoDB Atlas) for this project so you don't need to worry about data


 Now you are ready to start the server by running this command in the terminal

 ```
npm start
```

### FrontEnd

The first thing you need to do is install the node_modules by running this command in the terminal

```
npm i
```
 Now you are ready to start the project running this command in the terminal

 ```
npm start
```
the browser should open automatically the App.
if that does not happen paste this link in your browser.
